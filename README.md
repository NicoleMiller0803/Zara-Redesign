Zara Homepage Redesgin for LSC 532

This is a project for my LSC 532 "Web Design for the Sciences" class, where we were assigned the task of redesigning a poorly designed website homepage. I opted to revamp the Zara homepage, drawing inspiration from other luxury brands and the original Zara page.

The process began by creating a mockup in Adobe XD, followed by coding using HTML, CSS, and JS.
